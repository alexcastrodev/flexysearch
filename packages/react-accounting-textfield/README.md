## Tests

Storybook provides a clean-room environment for testing components in isolation. Stories make it easy to explore a component in all its variations, no matter how complex.

That means stories are a pragmatic starting point for your UI testing strategy. You already write stories as a natural part of UI development, testing those stories is a low-effort way to prevent UI bugs over time.

```bash
yarn test-storybook
```
